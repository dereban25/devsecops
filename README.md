To use the script, you need to follow these steps:

1. Copy the updated script to a file, for example, `pre-commit.sh`.

2. Make the script executable by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   chmod +x pre-commit.sh
   ```

3. Move the script to the `.git/hooks` directory of your Git repository:
   ```
   mv pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

4. Optionally, you can configure Git to automatically enable the pre-commit hook by setting the `core.hooksPath` configuration:
   ```
   git config core.hooksPath .git/hooks
   ```

5. Now, whenever you make a commit in your repository, the pre-commit hook script will be executed, and it will run gitleaks to check for secrets. If any secrets are found, the commit will be rejected; otherwise, the commit will be allowed.

Make sure you have gitleaks installed on your system, or the script will automatically install it for you based on your operating system.

Please note that the script assumes you are running it in a Linux or macOS environment. If you are using a different operating system, you may need to modify the script accordingly.

Remember to review and test the script before using it in a production environment.
